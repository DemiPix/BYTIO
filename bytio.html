      During July of 2022, Shyel Singh and Tyler Le decided they wanted to find a 
      way to bring technology to everyone, starting at their own school, Tesoro High School. 
      This would be done through a club they would form called BYTIO in which people could
      sign up and learn about the different parts of a computer, how one would know which one
      to buy, how it works with the other parts, and how to put it in their very own computer.
