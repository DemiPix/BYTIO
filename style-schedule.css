<strong>August-Dec 2022</strong>
    <br>
    <strong>The beginning of a club</strong>
    <br>
    Throughout the months of August to December of 2022, the club was formed and met every other week to discuss one part at a time as the group went through the computer. Questions were asked, brownies were given, and fun was had as kids from Tesoro began to extend their knowledge about the computer and its hardware.
</div>
<div style="border-left:thin solid black; height: 40px; position:absolute; left:480px; top: 255px"></div>
<div class="rectangle3">
    <strong>Dec-Jan 2022-23</strong>
    <br>
    <strong>Reconvention</strong>
    <br>
    During December and January, Shyel and Tyler discussed how they could make the club and organization better. The people were learning, but not in the way that was intended when the idea first formed. They decided the best way to go about it was to use a model PC during each meeting to <i>show</i> everyone how each thing fit together and had its place.
</div>
<div style="border-left:thin solid black; height: 40px; position:absolute; left:760px; top: 255px"></div>
<div class="rectangle4">
    <strong>Present Day</strong>
    <br>
    <strong>Going well</strong>
    <br>
    During the present day, when there is not a scheduling conflict with track meets or field trips, meetings still happen every two weeks. Those who come always leave with more knowledge than they arrived with and the addition of the model PC allows everyone to get hands-on experience, readying them for the real world and their own computer whether they build a new one or repair their own.

    <strong>July 2022</strong>
    <br>
    <strong>An idea was formed</strong>
    <br>
    During July of 2022, Shyel Singh and Tyler Le decided they wanted to find a way to bring technology to everyone, starting at their own school, Tesoro High School. This would be done through a club they would form called BYTIO in which people could sign up and learn about the different parts of a computer, how one would know which one to buy, how it works with the other parts, and how to put it in their very own computer.
